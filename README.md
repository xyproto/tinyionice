# Tiny I/O Nice

This is a fork of `ionice` from [util-linux](https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux)

It is a drop-in replacement for `ionice` in just 300 lines of C and under a single open source license.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/tinyionice.svg)](https://repology.org/project/tinyionice/versions)

* Support for obsolete systems is removed.
* The translated output messages are removed.
* Other than that it's a fully featured drop-in replacement for `ionice`.
* The resulting executable is only 11k when built with GCC 11 on Linux (and then stripped with `sstrip`).
* `util-linux` uses several open source licenses across many different files. This fork is only based on files licensed under GPL2. `tinyionice` is only GPL2 licensed.
